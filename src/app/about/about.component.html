      <h1 style="text-align:center;"> Why I write Quotes</h1>
      <p style="text-align: center;">Because I feel misunderstood, I guess. Because it never comes out clearly enough
        when I tries to speak.
        Because I want to rephrase the world, to take it in and give it back again differently,
        so that everything is used and nothing is lost. Because itâ€™s something to do to pass the time until
        I am old enough to experience the things I write about,don't know about you!</p>
